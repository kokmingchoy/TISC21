# TISC21

This is my write-up for The InfoSecurity Challenge (TISC) 2021 by the Center for Strategic Technologies (CSIT).
I came in in the top 50 out of about 500 registered players, managing to complete all of the challenges on Levels 1 and 2, and progressing through about 30% and 95% of the solution to the challenges on Levels 3 and 4 respectively.

This was my very first competitive CTF (Capture-The-Flag) event and I found it to be a great learning experience. 
I was forced to use tools which I had only been aware of but never used practically, and also tools which I had never heard of before this CTF event.
