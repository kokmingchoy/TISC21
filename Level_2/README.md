# Level 2 - Part 1

Viewing the provided `traffic.pcap` file in **Wireshark**, I noted that it contained data for 19,487 packets of DNS query responses for various query names in the following format:<br>
> d33d**xxxxxxxxx**.tentopspot.net

The interesting part of the query name was the varying 9-character portion after "d33d".
I collected those characters into a single file with the following procedures:

First, use **tshark** to pipe the data from `traffic.pcap` through **sed** to extract the interesting 9-character string from each of the DNS packets:
```bash
tshark -r traffic.pcap | sed -n -r 's/.*?d33d(.*?)\.tentopspot.*/\1/p' >> dns.txt
```

The resultant `dns.txt` had line breaks which needed to be removed:
```bash
tr -d '\n' < dns.txt > dns2.txt
```

Now I had `dns2.txt` which looked something like the following:
```

```

I investigated the contents of `dns2.txt` using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) in an attempt to figure out what kind of encoding it may be in, but did not have any conclusive results initially.

Then I noticed that the characters "d33d" in the domain name were _always_ followed by 2 digits. I thought it would be very unlikely that any encoding scheme would have 2 digits occurring at regular intervals, separated by 7 other characters. So I decided to ignore those 2 digits following the characters "d33d" and collected the 7-character strings into a single file:
```bash
tshark -r traffic.pcap | sed -n -r 's/.*?d33d..(.*?)\.ten.*/\1/p' >> dns3.txt
tr -d '\n' < dns3.txt > dns4.txt
```

The resultant `dns4.txt` now looked like this:
```

```

I noted that there were only uppercase characters in there, so the data could not be Base64-encoded.<br>
(Base64 uses the character set `A-Za-z0-9+/=`).
What about Base32 encoding? (Base32 uses the character set `A-Z2-7=` and the digits '0' and '1' were noticeably missing from the data in `dns4.txt`)

Using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base32('A-Z2-7%3D',true)&input=TlJYWEVaTE5FQlVYQTQzVk5VUUdJMDQzM01ONVpDMDJBNDNKT1FRMDJHQzNMRk9RMTdXQ0FRS0NJMDFOQ0VLUlNIMDFKQkVVVVMyMDFNSlZIRTZVMDFDUktKSlZJMDlWS1dLNU1GMDFTV1JRR0VaMDFER05CVkdZMDEzVFFPTEJNMDFKUldJWkxHMDlNNVVHUzJU) with the "From Base32" recipe revealed readable text:

More importantly, it revealed our flag!
