Viewing the provided `traffic.pcap` file in **Wireshark**, I noted that it contained data for 19,487 packets of DNS query responses for various query names in the following format:<br>
> d33d**xxxxxxxxx**.tentopspot.net

The interesting part of the query name was the varying 9-character portion after "d33d".
I collected those characters into a single file with the following procedures:

First, use **tshark** to pipe the data from `traffic.pcap` through **sed** to extract the interesting 9-character string from each of the DNS packets:
```bash
tshark -r traffic.pcap | sed -n -r 's/.*?d33d(.*?)\.tentopspot.*/\1/p' >> dns.txt
```

The resultant `dns.txt` had line breaks which needed to be removed:
```bash
tr -d '\n' < dns.txt > dns2.txt
```

Now I had `dns2.txt` which looked something like the following:
```

(truncated for brevity)
```

I investigated the contents of `dns2.txt` using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) in an attempt to figure out what kind of encoding it may be in, but did not have any conclusive results initially.

Then I noticed that the characters "d33d" in the domain name were _always_ followed by 2 digits. I thought it would be very unlikely that any encoding scheme would have 2 digits occurring at regular intervals, separated by 7 other characters. So I decided to ignore those 2 digits following the characters "d33d" and collected the 7-character strings into a single file:
```bash
tshark -r traffic.pcap | sed -n -r 's/.*?d33d..(.*?)\.ten.*/\1/p' >> dns3.txt
tr -d '\n' < dns3.txt > dns4.txt
```

The resultant `dns4.txt` now looked like this:
```

```

I noted that there were only uppercase characters in there, so the data could not be Base64-encoded.<br>
(Base64 uses the character set `A-Za-z0-9+/=`).
What about Base32 encoding? (Base32 uses the character set `A-Z2-7=` and the digits '0' and '1' were noticeably missing from the data in `dns4.txt`)

Using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base32('A-Z2-7%3D',true)&input=TlJYWEVaTE5FQlVYQTQzVk5VUUdJMDQzM01ONVpDMDJBNDNKT1FRMDJHQzNMRk9RMTdXQ0FRS0NJMDFOQ0VLUlNIMDFKQkVVVVMyMDFNSlZIRTZVMDFDUktKSlZJMDlWS1dLNU1GMDFTV1JRR0VaMDFER05CVkdZMDEzVFFPTEJNMDFKUldJWkxHMDlNNVVHUzJU) with the "From Base32" recipe revealed readable text:

More importantly, it revealed our flag! <br>
Being 17 characters in length, this was actually the Level 2 Part 2 flag.


ðŸš© **Level 2 Part 2 flag: `TISC{n3vEr_0dd_0r_Ev3n}`**

<br>

I got the Base32-decoded text into a separate file `dns4_decoded.txt`:
```bash
base32 -d dns4.txt > dns4_decoded.txt
```

Inspecting the contents of `dns4_decoded.txt` in a text editor (I used **Sublime**) revealed that there was only that one flag in there.<br>
The readable text was all on one single line and portions of the text repeated.<br>
After the readable text came repeated chunks of data, some of which were non-printable. <br>

<br>
I suspected the other flag was to be obtained from the data derived from the 2 digits after the characters "d33d", which I ignored previously.

I grabbed those digits from `traffic.pcap` and put them in a file `digits.txt`:
```bash
tshark -r traffic.pcap | sed -n -r 's/.*d33d(..).*/\1/p' > digits.txt
```

Inspecting the numbers in `digits.txt` using CyberChef, I noted that the numbers ranged from 01 through 64, and all numbers in this range had appeared in the file with more or less an even frequency distribution.

<br>

The use of 64 unique values to encode data strongly suggests the use of Base64 encoding, although we would have to translate the numerical values in `digits.txt` to something resembling Base64-encoded data.

I wrote the following Python script to convert the data (in Decimal) in `digits.txt` to hopefully valid Base64-encoded data in `digits_base64`:

```python
# Our Base64 translation table
table = [b'A', b'B', b'C', b'D', b'E', b'F', b'G', b'H', b'I', b'J', b'K', b'L', b'M', b'N', b'O', b'P', b'Q', b'R', b'S', b'T', b'U', b'V', b'W',
b'X', b'Y', b'Z', b'a', b'b', b'c', b'd', b'e', b'f', b'g', b'h', b'i', b'j', b'k', b'l', b'm', b'n', b'o', b'p', b'q', b'r', b's', b't',
b'u', b'v', b'w', b'x', b'y', b'z', b'0', b'1', b'2', b'3', b'4', b'5', b'6', b'7', b'8', b'9', b'+', b'/']

with open("digits.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.readlines()

output = []
for i in data:
    output.append(table[int(i)-1])

out_bytes = b''.join(output)

with open("digits_base64.txt", "wb") as f:
    f.write(out_bytes)
    
```
<br>

Now I performed Base64-decoding on the file `digits_base64.txt`:
```bash
base64 -d digits_base64.txt > digits_base64_decoded
```

<br>

**base64** complained of invalid input, but the file `digits_base64_decoded` still got written with 14,615 bytes.

Inspecting the file `digits_base64_decoded` in **Ghex** revealed that it could very well be a Zip file!

<br>

Running `unzip -l digits_base64_decoded` confirmed it was a Zip file:
